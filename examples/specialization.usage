# Here's how we can use specialization to leverage each shell's builtin capability to complete users on the system:

cmd <USER>;

<USER@bash> ::= {{{ compgen -A user "$1" | sort | uniq }}}; # bash produces duplicates for some reason
<USER@fish> ::= {{{ __fish_complete_users "$1" }}};
<USER@zsh> ::= {{{ _users }}};
