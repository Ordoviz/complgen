# Value Proposition

`complgen` allows you to generate completion scripts for all major shells (bash, zsh, fish) from a *single*,
concise grammar.  It's inspired by [compleat](https://github.com/mbrubeck/compleat/) but instead of requiring
for the `compleat` executable to be available at completion time, it compiles the grammar down to a standalone
shell script that can be distributed on its own.  You can, for instance, generate completion scripts for your
command line tool on CI and package them along with your command line tool.  No additional software needs to
be installed in order to use those custom completions.

## Usage

The command:

    cargo run --release <usage/darcs.usage

will generate `darcs.bash` and `darcs.fish` in the current directory that can be sourced in the respective
shells to get `darcs` completions.

## Rationale

Although various libraries exist for parsing command line arguments that can generate shell completions for
you (e.g. clap), `complgen` has the advantage of being just a command line tool and thus not being tied to any
particular implementation language.  The disadvantage, of course, is that now, parsing and completions are
maintained separately from each other risking divergence.  On balance, it is deemed still worth it.

# Status

 * Generates working completion scripts for `bash` and `fish`.  `zsh` can use `bash` script [via bash
   compatibility mode](https://stackoverflow.com/a/8492043).
 * The implementation is still a bit dirty.  There's lots of room for optimization.

# Syntax

The grammar is based on [compleat](https://github.com/mbrubeck/compleat/blob/master/README.markdown#syntax)'s one.

 * `a b` matches `a` followed by `b`.
 * `a b | c` matches either `a b` or `c`.
 * `[a]` matches zero or one occurrences of `a`.
 * `a ...` matches one or more occurrences of `a`.
 * `[a] ...` matches zero or more occurrences of `a`.

Use parentheses to group patterns:

 * `a (b | c)` matches `a` followed by either `b` or `c`.
 * `(a | b) ...` matches `a` or `b` followed by any number of additional
   `a` or `b`.

Patterns may also include *variables*:

# Limitations

 * Grouping single character options into a single shell parameter isn't supported, e.g. `tar -xvf`.  You need
   to pass each option in a separate shell argument instead: `tar -x -v -f`

 * Passing option arguments using `=` is not supported.  E.g. `--foo=bar` doesn't work, but `--foo bar` does.

# Roadmap

 * Implement strings interning to speed it up and to deduplicate strings in resulting scripts.
 * Generate DFA directly from the grammar instead of going through Grammar -> áµ‹-NFA -> NFA -> DFA.
 * Implement DFA minimization

 * End-to-end tests that excercise the generation completion scripts and check they behave properly.

 * `name ::= expression;` defines a new production that can be referred to from other productions via `<name>`
   syntax.  Referring to a production recursively won't be supported as that would take us outside of regular languages.

 * `name = { shell-command... }` defines a variable that uses a shell command to generate suggested
   completions.  The shell command should print one suggested completion per line.  The `$COMP_LINE` and
   `$COMP_CWORD` environment will contain the input line and the current word being completed.

 * If no value is defined for `name`, then the pattern `<name>` will match any word.

 * DRY to_dot fns into a trait fn
